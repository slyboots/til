title: "Iv"
things:
    - I learned about the existence of the react-testing library (_YAY_)
    - I learned about [the rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) (_not sure how I missed them previously)
    - I finally figured out how to get my eslint / prettier / prettier-eslint-cli / nvim prettier plugin to all work together consistently
