title: "I Make A Lot Of Mistakes"
things:
    - I learned that ssh tunnels to production database environments are a bad idea.
    - I learned a little bit more about dumping sql dbs. Like how to dump just specific tables and not include `DROP` statements when dumping.
    - I learned that changing shit directly in the DB is a massive headache and I never want to do it again.
